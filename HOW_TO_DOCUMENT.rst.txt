MXNet Documentation Guidelines
====================================

This document provides guidelines for documenting _MXNet_.

APIs
--------
For docstrings, we adhere to the [NumPy documentation guidelines](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

Please note that we observe the following additional conventions:

Import Conventions
```````````````
In addition to importing::

  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib as mpl
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

We also assume that mxnet has been imported in the following way::

  import mxnet as mx


Variable names, functions, class names, and tuples of returned values
```````````````
For variable names, function names, or class names, we observe the NumPy convention of presenting them in single backticks.

However, whenever code is invoked, even to retrieve an attribute of an object, we present this in double backticks, e.g.,  ``x.attribute``. 

Note: NDArray is a class name. When standing alone (not in a code block) it should always appear in single backticks.

True, False, and None 
```````````````
Throughout the NumPy documentation there appears to be disagreement about whether boolean literals (``True`` and ``False``) or the special value ``None`` should appear with zero, single, or double backticks. 

To resolve any ambiguity, we adopt the convention of presenting all three in doube backticks.
